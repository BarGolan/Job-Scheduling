file type = 1 (for initial scheduling by policy)

machine 0 : speed (a double value larger than 0)	policy (an int value between 0 - 4) if policy is 4 - a priority list of job IDs
machine 1 : speed (a double value larger than 0)	policy (an int value between 0 - 4) if policy is 4 - a priority list of job IDs

machine n-1 : speed (a double value larger than 0)	policy (an int value between 0 - 4) if policy is 4 - a priority list of job IDs
job 0 processing time (a double value between 1 - 10)
job 1 processing time (a double value between 1 - 10)

job n-1 processing time (a double value between 1 - 10)

**Attention: for the speed value - it is imperative to write as double, for example 1.0 and not 1
             This is the only diffence against a priority list that is not in the correct length
